Below is a structured senior‑level review focused on suitability for a production / consumer embedded device. I’ve grouped observations into categories, with concrete improvement suggestions, pros/cons, and potential impact on existing users.

----------------------------------------------------------------
High Priority Functional / Behavioral Items
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Long press interval default = 0
Issue: DEFAULT_LONG_PRESS_INTERVAL_MS is 0. In OCS_PRESS you test:
 if ((now - lastDuringLongPressTime) >= longPressIntervalMs)
If longPressIntervalMs == 0 the condition is always true, so duringLongPressFunc() will fire on every OB_Tick call (potentially at a very high rate), which can starve the rest of the system or inflate CPU usage.
Recommendation:
- Treat 0 as “disabled” (skip block entirely) OR enforce a minimum of 1 ms upon setting.
Pros: Prevents runaway callback execution.
Cons: Changes behavior for anyone relying (maybe unintentionally) on the current rapid firing.
Impact: Users who set interval 0 expecting very fast repeated callbacks will need to adjust (document migration).

2. OB_GetPressedMs truncates to uint16_t
Issue: Returns (now - startTime) cast/truncated to uint16_t, overflow ~65.535 s. Wait times internally use uint32_t.
Recommendation:
- Change return type to uint32_t.
Pros: Accurate durations for long presses / diagnostics; consistent with HAL tick size.
Cons: API change (breaking binary / source if prototypes assumed).
Impact: Downstream code using uint16_t will need adjustments.

3. Negative debounce_ms semantics unclear / asymmetric
Issue: If (btnActive && debounce_ms < 0) debouncedLevel = btnActive; release still goes through normal debounce. This “fast path” only for presses, undocumented.
Recommendation:
- Define explicit meaning: e.g. debounce_ms < 0 disables debouncing entirely OR provide OB_SetDebounceDisabled(bool).
- Or require debounce_ms >= 0 and remove negative usage.
Pros: Predictable, documented behavior; prevents subtle bugs.
Cons: Small refactor; might break hidden reliance on current quirk.
Impact: Users who intentionally used negative value need guidance.

4. Idle callback behavior & state flag
Issue: Idle callback fires once after idle_ms with state OCS_INIT; subsequent ticks while idle do nothing (idleFunc not repeated) until activity occurs & Reset is called. This may or may not match user expectations.
Recommendation:
- Document “fires once per inactivity period” or provide mode to repeat at interval (e.g. idle_repeat_ms).
Pros: Clarity; optional recurring idle actions.
Cons: Additional state or configuration.
Impact: None if documented; new feature optional.

5. Abs usage with int16_t debounce_ms
Issue: Using abs(debounce_ms); if int is 32-bit this is fine, but semantic mixing of signed/unsigned is fragile. (Edge case: -32768 still fine on typical platforms, but conceptually awkward.)
Recommendation:
- Make debounce_ms an int32_t or uint16_t and use unsigned logic; or clamp.
Pros: Cleaner, MISRA friendlier.
Cons: Minor code churn.
Impact: Minimal.

6. Max clicks scaling logic implicit & magic numbers
Issue: Attaching OB_EV_DOUBLE_CLICK forces maxClicks ≥ 2; multi-click forces ≥ 100. “100” is a hidden limit. No way to configure other maximums.
Recommendation:
- Provide OB_SetMaxClicks(uint16_t n) or parameter when attaching multi-click callback.
Pros: Flexible; explicit design.
Cons: Slightly larger API.
Impact: Existing behavior unchanged unless user adopts new API.

7. During long press first interval timing
Issue: lastDuringLongPressTime initialized to 0; after entering OCS_PRESS the first duringLongPressFunc invocation may be delayed or may fire immediately depending on interval and system uptime. More determinism if you set lastDuringLongPressTime = now when transitioning to OCS_PRESS or immediately invoke once then set anchor.
Recommendation:
- In OCS_DOWN when promoting to OCS_PRESS (long press start) set lastDuringLongPressTime = now, then in OCS_PRESS only run when (now - lastDuringLongPressTime) >= interval.
Pros: Predictable cadence.
Cons: Slight API behavior change for first callback timing.
Impact: Users might see one fewer immediate duringLongPress callback.

8. Lack of null pointer checks in some setters / getters
Issue: Some functions assume btn != NULL (e.g., setters). If misused, can crash.
Recommendation:
- Add defensive checks or assert macros (configurable).
Pros: Safety.
Cons: A few extra instructions unless compiled out.
Impact: None if macro-controlled.

9. Concurrency / Interrupt safety
Issue: OB_Tick reads and writes fields that callbacks may also inspect. If callbacks run in different context (e.g., called from IRQ or scheduled tasks) there’s a race. Currently no volatile qualifiers or locking.
Recommendation:
- Document intended single-threaded (cooperative) usage OR add lightweight lock/disable IRQ boundary around state mutation (optional config).
Pros: Clarity; avoids subtle race conditions.
Cons: Extra complexity if enabling concurrency.
Impact: Documentation may suffice.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Moderate Priority Design / API Improvements
----------------------------------------------------------------
10. Add user context pointer for callbacks
Issue: Callbacks are no-arg; users must rely on global/static variables for per-instance context.
Recommendation:
- Extend struct with void* userData and pass it (or create a second attach variant).
Pros: Reentrant, more flexible (esp. in multi-button arrays).
Cons: Slight API expansion; existing callbacks unaffected if you keep legacy attach.
Impact: Backwards compatible if optional.

11. Provide alternative tick interface with raw level
Issue: Testing and simulation currently require GPIO & HAL. OB_Tick always samples hardware.
Recommendation:
- Add OB_TickRaw(OneButton_t*, bool activeLevel) for unit tests or non-HAL platforms.
Pros: Testability & portability.
Cons: Slight extra function.
Impact: None unless adopted.

12. Explicit initialization state flag
Issue: OB_IsIdle returns (state == OCS_INIT) which conflates “idle” with “unpressed baseline”. If you want to distinguish “initialized but not yet used” vs true “idle gap”, it’s not explicit.
Recommendation:
- Add a separate bool initialized; or rename OB_IsIdle to OB_IsInBaselineState.
Pros: Semantic clarity.
Cons: Minor struct change.
Impact: Users relying on current semantics should adapt.

13. Naming consistency
Issue: OCS_PRESSEND vs maybe OCS_RELEASE or OCS_LONG_RELEASE. OCS_PRESSEND triggers longPressStop.
Recommendation:
- Rename or clearly document states and transitions in header comments.
Pros: Maintainability.
Cons: Renaming is a breaking change unless you keep old alias.
Impact: Moderate if exposed publicly.

14. Extended event reasoning
Issue: A normal short press can produce pressFunc (immediate) then clickFunc later; for long press you get pressFunc, longPressStartFunc, optional repeated duringLongPressFunc, longPressStopFunc, but no click event. This is fine but should be explicitly documented (some libraries optionally also fire click after a long press).
Recommendation:
- Document event sequence; optionally add a config flag to also emit click after long press.
Pros: Predictability; configurable UX.
Cons: Slight code/path complexity.
Impact: Optional; default behavior unchanged.

15. API for reconfiguration while running
Issue: Changing intervals mid-press might create edge behaviors (e.g., press_ms lowered below elapsed time) without immediate state transition.
Recommendation:
- Document that changes take effect next cycle / recommend only updating in idle state, or implement logic to re-evaluate on change.
Pros: Reliability.
Cons: Additional complexity if dynamic.
Impact: Documentation likely sufficient.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Robustness, Safety & Compliance
----------------------------------------------------------------
16. MISRA / Safety style adjustments (if targeting consumer electronics with regulatory demands)
Suggestions:
- Avoid implicit integral promotions (cast results of HAL_GPIO_ReadPin to uint8_t explicitly).
- Use enum-scoped switch default with assert(0) or a safe recovery path (you already default to OCS_INIT, which is acceptable—add comment).
- Replace magic numbers (100) with #define OB_DEFAULT_MAX_CLICKS_MULTI 100.
- Use static inline accessors for performance-critical trivials.
Pros: Easier certification, static analysis passes with fewer suppressions.
Cons: Minor verbosity.
Impact: Transparent to users.

17. Tick rollover handling
Issue: HAL_GetTick (uint32_t) wraps ~49.7 days. Subtraction logic is safe modulo 2^32. This should be documented to reassure developers; returning uint16_t (already flagged) breaks that assurance.
Recommendation:
- After moving to uint32_t for press durations, explicitly note wrap-safe arithmetic.
Pros: Confidence & audit readiness.
Cons: Documentation only.
Impact: None.

18. Debounce algorithm sophistication
Issue: Current debounce uses a simple stable-period method. For very noisy lines (EMI, ESD bursts) you might want:
- A counter-based majority filter or requiring N consecutive identical samples (if OB_Tick frequency is fixed).
Recommendation:
- Provide optional compile-time strategy selection (#define OB_DEBOUNCE_STRATEGY_SIMPLE / FILTERED).
Pros: Better robustness in harsh electrical environments.
Cons: Increases code size if both included.
Impact: Optional enhancement.

19. Power / call frequency
Issue: High-frequency polling wastes power. No adaptive timing: still requires user to call OB_Tick frequently to achieve debounce resolution.
Recommendation:
- Provide a guideline (e.g., call every 1–5 ms) in documentation.
- Optionally add OB_NeedSoonerTick() returning minimal next desired interval (e.g., time till click window close) to allow dynamic sleep scheduling.
Pros: Facilitates low-power designs.
Cons: Slightly more code and state.
Impact: Backward compatible.

20. Reentrancy of callbacks
Issue: Callbacks are invoked inside state machine; if a callback calls OB_Tick again (recursion) you could have state corruption.
Recommendation:
- Document: “Do not call OB_Tick from within callbacks” OR add a reentrancy guard bool inProgress.
Pros: Prevents subtle bugs.
Cons: Few bytes extra memory.
Impact: Safe default.

21. Error feedback
Issue: Many setters don’t validate ranges (e.g., press_ms < click_ms is odd but allowed). Press threshold smaller than click could produce ambiguous semantics.
Recommendation:
- Add optional validation + return bool success.
Pros: Early detection of misconfiguration.
Cons: Slight overhead.
Impact: API expansion (non-breaking if new functions or retained void variant).

----------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation & Usability
----------------------------------------------------------------
22. Clarify event timing diagram
Recommendation:
- Provide ASCII timing diagram in header / README: show transitions & callback order.
Pros: Reduces misuse, support burden.
Cons: Documentation effort.
Impact: Positive.

23. Example code & test harness
Recommendation:
- Provide example of initialization, attaching callbacks, activeLow vs activeHigh wiring, unit test harness that feeds synthetic levels.
Pros: Adoption & correctness.
Cons: Some effort.
Impact: Positive only.

24. Changelog & semantic versioning
Recommendation:
- Adopt semantic version (e.g., 0.2.0 for API changes flagged above).
Pros: Communicates breaking changes.
Cons: Process overhead.
Impact: Predictable updates for users.

25. Portability abstraction
Issue: Direct dependency on stm32f4xx_hal.h limits reuse on other MCUs.
Recommendation:
- Introduce a small adapter header (e.g., ob_hal.h) with inline wrappers:
  uint32_t OB_GetMillis();
  uint8_t  OB_ReadPin(void* port, uint16_t pin);
Pros: Portable to other HALs (LL drivers, different STM32 families, bare-metal).
Cons: Slight indirection.
Impact: Existing code can define default macros mapping to HAL.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Micro-optimizations (Low Priority)
----------------------------------------------------------------
26. Inline trivial getters
Pros: Reduces call overhead if used in tight loops.
Cons: Code size growth minimal.
Impact: Tiny; optional.

27. Combine state & flags
Issue: idleState plus state OCS_INIT could be packed into bitfields to save bytes in memory-constrained MCUs.
Pros: Minor RAM saving.
Cons: Less clarity.
Impact: Optional.

28. Remove redundant startTime resets
Verify necessity of some startTime updates (e.g., both OB_Reset and some transitions). Keeping them consistent is okay; just comment why.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Potential Breaking Changes Summary
----------------------------------------------------------------
If you implement all high priority adjustments, breaking changes likely include:
- Changing OB_GetPressedMs return type (uint16_t -> uint32_t).
- Altering default longPressIntervalMs semantics (0 meaning disabled vs continuous firing).
- Clarifying/removing “negative debounce_ms special meaning.”
- Possible renaming of states (if you choose to).
Mitigation: Bump major version; provide migration notes: “If you relied on 0 interval for high-rate duringLongPress callbacks, set interval to 1 and adjust tick frequency.”

----------------------------------------------------------------
Suggested Stepwise Improvement Plan
----------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 1 (Non-breaking, safety & docs):
- Add documentation for current behaviors (long press interval=0 effect, negative debounce).
- Add context pointer & raw tick function (optional).
- Add reentrancy guard & null checks.
- Add unit tests (simulated sequence: single, double, long, multi, idle).

Phase 2 (Minor breaks, improved semantics):
- Change default longPressIntervalMs to a sensible non-zero or treat 0 as disabled.
- Deprecate negative debounce semantics (emit warning macro if <0).
- Extend maxClicks configurability.

Phase 3 (Portability & power):
- Abstract HAL dependency.
- Provide OB_NextDeadline / OB_NeedSoonerTick helper for low-power scheduling.

Phase 4 (Advanced features):
- Alternative debounce strategies.
- Configurable inclusion/exclusion of idle / multi-click / during-long-press to reduce code size (compile-time feature flags).

----------------------------------------------------------------
Quick Code Edits (Illustrative Snippets)
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Guard in OB_Tick:
if (!btn) return;
if (btn->pin == INVALID_PIN) return;

2. Long press interval handling:
void OB_SetLongPressIntervalMs(OneButton_t* btn, uint16_t ms) {
    if (!btn) return;
    btn->longPressIntervalMs = ms;
}

In OCS_PRESS:
if (btn->longPressIntervalMs > 0 &&
    (btn->now - btn->lastDuringLongPressTime) >= btn->longPressIntervalMs) {
    ...
}

3. Initialize lastDuringLongPressTime when entering OCS_PRESS:
case OCS_DOWN:
  ...
  else if (waitTime > btn->press_ms) {
      if (btn->longPressStartFunc) btn->longPressStartFunc();
      btn->lastDuringLongPressTime = btn->now;
      OB_NewState(btn, OCS_PRESS);
  }

4. Replace negative debounce with explicit disable flag:
Add bool debounceEnabled; (default true)
In OB_Debounce:
if (!btn->debounceEnabled) { btn->debouncedLevel = btnActive; return btnActive; }

(Or keep old behavior behind #ifdef.)

5. Context pointer:
typedef void (*OneButtonCallback)(void* ctx);
Add void* userData; pass to callbacks.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Testing Recommendations
----------------------------------------------------------------
Create automated test vectors:
- Sequence: Press < debounce, release quickly (bounce simulation) -> no false press.
- Single click: press/release under press_ms, ensure pressFunc then clickFunc only.
- Double click: two quick presses < click_ms between; ensure doubleClickFunc only.
- Multi click (e.g. 5): verify multiClickFunc and nClicks == 5.
- Long press: hold > press_ms; verify longPressStartFunc then (optional) duringLongPressFunc at configured intervals, then longPressStopFunc on release, no click events.
- Idle: no activity for idle_ms => idleFunc called once.
- Edge: Changing intervals mid-press (document expected result).
Automate with a simulated “time” counter substituting HAL_GetTick.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
----------------------------------------------------------------
The core finite state machine is straightforward and generally correct for the common button interaction patterns. The primary production readiness gaps are: (1) ambiguous semantics (longPressInterval 0, negative debounce), (2) lack of documentation around event ordering and configuration constraints, (3) potential runaway duringLongPress callback frequency, (4) limited testability & portability, and (5) minor API limitations (no user context). Addressing these will elevate reliability, predictability, and integrability into a consumer device firmware stack.

Let me know if you’d like a concrete revised header/source patch applying a chosen subset of these recommendations, or a unit test scaffold.
